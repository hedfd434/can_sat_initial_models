## purpose of this repo:
this repo is a part of the PDR (Preeliminary Design Review), we want to show our capabilities in terms of the experimental development.

## content of the repo:
In folder fusion_model you can find fusion 360 native files of our project.
in Stl models you can find few models which we created during development

## how did We develop this model:
1. Sketch - We started with simple sketch on the real paper, with loose sugestions of the size (it helps to be creative, because the pencil is simpler tool).

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Initial sketches.</p>

2. CAD sketch - We started puting that what we have created on the paper to the digital world.

3. Printing - It required exporting file to the suitable format, and using specialized software to create proper files for the printer. After that we printed our models.

4. Review - We checked the real model in terms of the size and mass.

5. Retake - we changed that what was wrong with the previous model and We returned to the point nr.4 and after 2 models we decided to not to waste more material as it is only for test purposes.

6. Final decision - to achieve wanted mass, instead of adding more filling to the object, We Drilled 2 holes and poured the salt. after that everything we measured our model with the ballast (we use 70x8 threaded metal bars). at the end we sealed drilled holes by gluing them.

7. Documentation - during the whole process we were taking photos and notes.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> first model with the socket for the three rods.</p>

## Issues during development and how we cope with them:
1. mass balance - as the can-sat's are suppose to be between 300g and 350g that was our goal. At the begining we wanted to use only metal bars as the ballast, but finally we used salt pured into internall structure of our can-sat.
